Interview Flashcard App — Work in progress, plan to deploy shortly.

## Overview

Using Material UI/React, I'm building a simple CRUD app to compile questions/answers that could come up during technical interviews — including behavioral components, technical trivia (specifically JavaScript), and system design questions.

The use case would be for friends studying for technical interviews/myself to use to supplement our studying.
